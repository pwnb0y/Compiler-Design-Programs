# Experiment Number:1
## Using the LEX tool, Develop a lexical analyzer to recognize a few patterns in C. (Ex. identifiers,constants, comments, operators etc.). Create a symbol table, while recognizing identifiers.

## AIM:
To write a program to develop a lexical analyzer to recognize a few patterns in C.
## ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Declare and Initialize the required variable
Step 2: Declare and Initialize the required variable
Step 3: Check for the given list of keywords and print them as keywords if it is
encountered. Step 4: Similarly print the corresponding statements for numbers,
identifiers
Step 5: stop the program
